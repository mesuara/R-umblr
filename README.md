# R-umblr

My first full-stack project. This is a blog about the environment and recycle.
You are not required to have an account to see the posts on the blog but if you would like to contribute to the topic you are most welcome to do so. You can sign up and write your own post. Your posts are going to get posted on the blog page. You can't see other users, but you can see their posts. Why like that? I would like people to care more about the topic and less about the number of followers or the number of likes.
